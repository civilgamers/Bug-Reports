# CivilGamers Bug Reports

This is for CG / CC bug reports. Reports against players should be made in-game using the "@" sign or made over on our [forums][Complaints]. You can make a bug report by typing "!bugreport" in-game or by going [here][Bug Report].

**Sensitive reports should be made to a Senior Admin, Super Admin, or Management privately.** This includes gamebreaking and abusable bugs. Abusing these bugs without reporting them will lead to a permanent ban, while reporting them may lead to a bug bounty!
