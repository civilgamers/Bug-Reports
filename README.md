# CivilGamers Bug Reports
This is for CG / CC bug reports. Reports against players, however, should instead be made in-game by using "@\<message\>" or in a post over on our [forums][Complaints]. You can make a bug report on the GitHub [here][Bug Report] or by typing "!bugreport" anytime in-game.

**Abusable, game-breaking, or otherwise sensitive bugs and exploits** should be addressed to a Senior Admin, a Super Admin, or Management privately. Abusing these bugs without reporting them *will* lead to a permanent ban, so report them and you may receive a bug bounty!
